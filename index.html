        <p>Hello, My name is Isaac and this site is intended to serve as a portfolio to showcase my current & future skills in the form of a body of work.<br>

        development.

            <ul>
                <li><img src="Resources/vsc.png" id="icon"><br>VS Code <p id="hidden">I am able to work within both VS code and Visual Studio and have a
                    strong understanding of how both of these systems aught to be used as well as the extensions available to me. 
                    This portfolio was built in VS Code.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Resources/copilot.png" id="icon"><br>CoPilot<p id="hidden">I am able to make use of AI tools like CoPilot to confirm the intent of and run checks 
                    on code to catch errors and improve my understanding.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Resources/js.jpg" id="icon">JavaScript<p id="hidden">I am able to produce multifunction programs with JavaScript and incorporate them into web pages in such a way as to
                    allow modification to the look of the page, I have produced a Yahtzee game and an interactive pokedex as evidence of this skill.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Resources/htmlcss.jpg" id="icon">HTML & CSS<p id="hidden">I have a foundational understanding of both HTML and CSS and am able to use both in concert to produce functional web pages,
                    This is evidenced by this very site and the stylesheet it uses as well as several of my linked projects.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Resources/Sql.png" id="icon">SQL/SQLite<p id="hidden">I have built a familiarity with SQL and have used it to produce & query several simple databases both within the databases module of 
                    VS Code and through SQLite within Python.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Resources/Python.png" id="icon">Python<p id="hidden">I've developed an understanding of Python that i intend to further develop but what I have learned has enabled me to produce software
                    that can perform multiple functions including reading information from an API and display it to a user as shown in my example weather app</p></li>
                <li><img src="Resources/comms.jpg" id="icon">Communication<p id="hidden">I have broad and well developed communication skills honed in my previous work environments that allow me to effectively 
                    communicate with others while under stress. This allows me to walk others through a problem and collaborate to find solutions.</p></li>
